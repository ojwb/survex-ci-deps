This repo is to provide a mirror of source tarballs of third-party tools needed for CI builds of Survex. CI uses this mirror as it means we're less likely to fail to fetach these tarballs, and it avoids repeatedly fetching from the original download host.

This repo is unlikely to be interesting aside from this specific use.

For the licenses of these tools, see the source code of the tools themselves.
